# ParachuteGame
A simple game to encourage compliance among adolescent asthma patients.  

Tne Parachute game is connected to OpenSpirometry project. Mostly used raywenderlich.com to learn how to program in Sprite Kit 
or Apple's official API documentation. Still need to scale background image and improve image quality for background of parachute game and overall just refine its appearance. Initial images may need to be replaced, specifically the parachute man, with sprite sheet images to simulate "running" motion with seamless transitions. 

The WolfScene code is VERY rough. Not connected to OpenSpirometry yet. 

Future improvements needed:
1. Add a more basic gaming option, such as a changing color meter that moves up and down as the user performs the Spirometry test. 
2. Integrate with Asthma Health application.
